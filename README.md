### Author: Rajiv Raman
### Institution: Duke University
### Date: April 20th, 2025

## Overview

The project task was to build an annotated dataset of images, to train two different neural networks on object detection in these images, and to compare the performance of these models.

The dataset was annotated on Roboflow, and it can be publicly accessed here: https://app.roboflow.com/rajiv-ramans-machine-learning-workspace/aipi-590-acv-project-2/2.

The trained models were uploaded to Hugging Face, and they can be publicly accessed here: https://huggingface.co/spaces/rajivsraman4/object-detection-networks/tree/main.
